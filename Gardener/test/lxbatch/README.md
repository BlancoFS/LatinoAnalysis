gardening in lxbatch
====

The purpose is to have a set of modular scripts to run several steps of the gardening as modular as possible.
Each sample is run independently.
For each step a folder is created (eos) and used by all batch jobs running that particular step to store information

At the end of all jobs a list of folders is given: we can remove the intermediate steps if not needed
